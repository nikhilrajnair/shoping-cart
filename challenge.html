The challenge :

An e-commerce website has a page with multiple products in it. Each product has a price tag below the product image. You have to create a widget which when included finds all these price tags and puts a new price label jut below the original price showing the discounted price.

The discount rates are 
1. 20% - if the cost of the item is less than $100. 
2. 30% - $100 <= Cost of the item < $500 
3. 40% - Cost of the item >= $500

Other requirements 
1. Minimum cost of the item to get a discount is $20. If there is no discount, there is no need to show any label below the actual price. 
2. The HTML elements which contain the original price tags have class names in the format “price-”. For example, if product Id is 123, the element which holds the price tag has a class named “price-123”. 
3. The widget has to be a javascript file which can be included in any page of the e-commerce site.

PS :- You can create a sample webpage to display the products (of any number). Each product is a combination of image and price tag below the image. 
 This should no take more than 3 hours. You can submit the solution here whenever you are done.
